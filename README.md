# Mean_Shift_Exploration

An exploration of mean shift on various datasets provided by Scikit-Learn.

Topics examined: 
* The visualization of clusterings on various 2D datasets as well as datasets with higher dimensionality (i.e., Iris, Wine Datasets).
* Silhouette scores and Adjusted Rand Index scores of the mean-shift clusters on said datasets. 
* The effect of varying bandwidth values based using the quantile parameter of 'estimate_bandwidth'.
* How to choose the optimal bandwidth based on different requirements/metrics.
